# Design
- core: only PSL
- pass if modules are missing
- minimize dependencies, code
- test everything in the core framework

# small stuff
- @parameter? (or was it @attribute?) - remove getter/setters
- use __ for private

## Improvements
- app launcher (list of apps, themeable)
- github pages?

## TODO
- themes: use colors to improve theme readability
- convert some stuff to simple attributes to reduce LOCs
- use widget index for bumblebee-ctl as alternative (??)
- use pytest?

# documentation
Add info about error widget and events for error logging
- which location APIs are used?
