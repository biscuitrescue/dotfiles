datetz
~~~~~~

    * date.format: strftime()-compatible formatting string
    * date.locale: locale to use rather than the system default

deadbeef
~~~~~~~~

Displays the current song being played in DeaDBeeF and provides
some media control bindings.
Left click toggles pause, scroll up skips the current song, scroll
down returns to the previous song.

Parameters:
    * deadbeef.format:    Format string (defaults to '{artist} - {title}')
      Available values are: {artist}, {title}, {album}, {length},
      {trackno}, {year}, {comment},
      {copyright}, {time}
      This is deprecated, but much simpler.
    * deadbeef.tf_format: A foobar2000 title formatting-style format string.
      These can be much more sophisticated than the standard
      format strings. This is off by default, but specifying
      any tf_format will enable it. If both deadbeef.format
      and deadbeef.tf_format are specified, deadbeef.tf_format
      takes priority.
    * deadbeef.tf_format_if_stopped: Controls whether or not the tf_format format
      string should be displayed even if no song is paused or
      playing. This could be useful if you want to implement
      your own stop strings with the built in logic. Any non-
      null value will enable this (by default the module will
      hide itself when the player is stopped).
    * deadbeef.previous:  Change binding for previous song (default is left click)
    * deadbeef.next:      Change binding for next song (default is right click)
    * deadbeef.pause:     Change binding for toggling pause (default is middle click)

    Available options for deadbeef.previous, deadbeef.next and deadbeef.pause are:
        LEFT_CLICK, RIGHT_CLICK, MIDDLE_CLICK, SCROLL_UP, SCROLL_DOWN

zpool
~~~~~

Displays info about zpools present on the system

Requires the following executable:
    * sudo (if `zpool.sudo` is explicitly set to `true`)

Parameters:
   * zpool.list: Comma-separated list of zpools to display info for. If empty, info for all zpools
     is displayed. (Default: '')
   * zpool.format: Format string, tags {name}, {used}, {left}, {size}, {percentfree}, {percentuse},
     {status}, {shortstatus}, {fragpercent}, {deduppercent} are supported.
     (Default: '{name} {used}/{size} ({percentfree}%)')
   * zpool.showio: Show also widgets detailing current read and write I/O (Default: true)
   * zpool.ioformat: Format string for I/O widget, tags {ops} (operations per seconds) and {band}
     (bandwidth) are supported. (Default: '{band}')
   * zpool.warnfree: Warn if free space is below this percentage (Default: 10)
   * zpool.sudo: Use sudo when calling the `zpool` binary. (Default: false)

Option `zpool.sudo` is intended for Linux users using zfsonlinux older than 0.7.0: In pre-0.7.0
releases of zfsonlinux regular users couldn't invoke even informative commands such as
`zpool list`. If this option is true, command `zpool list` is invoked with sudo. If this option
is used, the following (or ekvivalent) must be added to the `sudoers(5)`:

```
<username/ALL> ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zpool list
```

Be aware of security implications of doing this!
