## Avatars for Mailspring

Simple, naive implementation of Avatars in the Message List.<br>
Add avatar before each email you receive, no more, no less !<br>
No caching, might do a lot of image requests.

Fork of [emadow](https://github.com/emadow/mailspring-avatars) project, thanks for his work !<br>
