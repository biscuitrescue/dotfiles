pulseaudio
~~~~~~~~~~

Displays volume and mute status and controls for PulseAudio devices. Use wheel up and down to change volume, left click mutes, right click opens pavucontrol.

!!! This module will eventually be deprecated (since it has bad performance and high CPU load) and be replaced with "pulsectl", which is a much better drop-in replacement !!!

Aliases: pasink (use this to control output instead of input), pasource

Parameters:
    * pulseaudio.autostart: If set to 'true' (default is 'false'), automatically starts the pulseaudio daemon if it is not running
    * pulseaudio.percent_change: How much to change volume by when scrolling on the module (default is 2%)
    * pulseaudio.limit: Upper limit for setting the volume (default is 0%, which means 'no limit')
      Note: If the left and right channels have different volumes, the limit might not be reached exactly.
    * pulseaudio.showbars: 1 for showing volume bars, requires --markup=pango;
      0 for not showing volume bars (default)
    * pulseaudio.showdevicename: If set to 'true' (default is 'false'), the currently selected default device is shown.
      Per default, the sink/source name returned by "pactl list sinks short" is used as display name.

      As this name is usually not particularly nice (e.g "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo"),
      its possible to map the name to more a user friendly name.

      e.g to map "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo" to the name "Headset", add the following
      bumblebee-status config entry: pulseaudio.alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo=Headset

      Furthermore its possible to specify individual (unicode) icons for all sinks/sources. e.g in order to use the icon 🎧 for the
      "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo" sink, add the following bumblebee-status config entry:
      pulseaudio.icon.alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo=🎧
    * Per default a left mouse button click mutes/unmutes the device. In case you want to open a dropdown menu to change the current
      default device add the following config entry to your bumblebee-status config: pulseaudio.left-click=select_default_device_popup

Requires the following executable:
    * pulseaudio
    * pactl
    * pavucontrol

.. image:: ../screenshots/pulseaudio.png

pulsectl
~~~~~~~~

Displays volume and mute status and controls for PulseAudio devices. Use wheel up and down to change volume, left click mutes, right click opens pavucontrol.

**Please prefer this module over the "pulseaudio" module, which will eventually be deprecated

Aliases: pulseout (for outputs, such as headsets, speakers), pulsein (for microphones)

NOTE: Do **not** use this module directly, but rather use either pulseout or pulsein!
NOTE2: For the parameter names below, please also use pulseout or pulsein, instead of pulsectl

Parameters:
    * pulsectl.autostart: If set to 'true' (default is 'false'), automatically starts the pulsectl daemon if it is not running
    * pulsectl.percent_change: How much to change volume by when scrolling on the module (default is 2%)
    * pulsectl.limit: Upper limit for setting the volume (default is 0%, which means 'no limit')
    * pulsectl.popup-filter: Comma-separated list of device strings (if the device name contains it) to exclude
      from the default device popup menu (e.g. Monitor for sources)
    * pulsectl.showbars: 'true' for showing volume bars, requires --markup=pango;
      'false' for not showing volume bars (default)
    * pulsectl.showdevicename: If set to 'true' (default is 'false'), the currently selected default device is shown.
      Per default, the sink/source name returned by "pactl list sinks short" is used as display name.

      As this name is usually not particularly nice (e.g "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo"),
      its possible to map the name to more a user friendly name.

      e.g to map "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo" to the name "Headset", add the following
      bumblebee-status config entry: pulsectl.alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo=Headset

      Furthermore its possible to specify individual (unicode) icons for all sinks/sources. e.g in order to use the icon 🎧 for the
      "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo" sink, add the following bumblebee-status config entry:
      pulsectl.icon.alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00.analog-stereo=🎧
    * Per default a left mouse button click mutes/unmutes the device. In case you want to open a dropdown menu to change the current
      default device add the following config entry to your bumblebee-status config: pulsectl.left-click=select_default_device_popup

datetz
~~~~~~

Parameters:
    * date.format: strftime()-compatible formatting string
    * date.locale: locale to use rather than the system default

deadbeef
~~~~~~~~

Displays the current song being played in DeaDBeeF and provides
some media control bindings.
Left click toggles pause, scroll up skips the current song, scroll
down returns to the previous song.

Parameters:
    * deadbeef.format:    Format string (defaults to '{artist} - {title}')
      Available values are: {artist}, {title}, {album}, {length},
      {trackno}, {year}, {comment},
      {copyright}, {time}
      This is deprecated, but much simpler.
    * deadbeef.tf_format: A foobar2000 title formatting-style format string.
      These can be much more sophisticated than the standard
      format strings. This is off by default, but specifying
      any tf_format will enable it. If both deadbeef.format
      and deadbeef.tf_format are specified, deadbeef.tf_format
      takes priority.
    * deadbeef.tf_format_if_stopped: Controls whether or not the tf_format format
      string should be displayed even if no song is paused or
      playing. This could be useful if you want to implement
      your own stop strings with the built in logic. Any non-
      null value will enable this (by default the module will
      hide itself when the player is stopped).
    * deadbeef.previous:  Change binding for previous song (default is left click)
    * deadbeef.next:      Change binding for next song (default is right click)
    * deadbeef.pause:     Change binding for toggling pause (default is middle click)

    Available options for deadbeef.previous, deadbeef.next and deadbeef.pause are:
        LEFT_CLICK, RIGHT_CLICK, MIDDLE_CLICK, SCROLL_UP, SCROLL_DOWN

Option `zpool.sudo` is intended for Linux users using zfsonlinux older than 0.7.0: In pre-0.7.0
releases of zfsonlinux regular users couldn't invoke even informative commands such as
`zpool list`. If this option is true, command `zpool list` is invoked with sudo. If this option
is used, the following (or ekvivalent) must be added to the `sudoers(5)`:

```
<username/ALL> ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zpool list
```

Be aware of security implications of doing this!
