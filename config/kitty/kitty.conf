# :     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features setting.

font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code Retina includes a discretionary
#: feature, zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the
#: zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code
#: Retina also includes other discretionary features known as
#: Stylistic Sets which have the tags ss01 through ss20.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, these are read from the FontConfig database first and
#: then this, setting is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use kitty + list-fonts
#: --psnames:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty + list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

copy_on_select no

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to

#: to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that
#: do not have the concept of primary selections. You can instead
#: specify a name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer
#: instead. Map a shortcut with the paste_from_buffer action to paste
#: from this private buffer. For example::

#: Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be
#: processed, repaint_delay is ignored.

input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs.

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  no
initial_window_width 1400
initial_window_height 800

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#layouts.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing
#: and the lines value for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 1pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified the unit is assumed to
#: be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders no

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 5

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead. A single value sets all
#: four sides. Two values set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three
#: values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right,
#: bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be on
#: only the bottom and right edges.
# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.
# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows
# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations titlebar-only

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: The time (in seconds) to wait before redrawing the screen when a
#: resize event is received. On platforms such as macOS, where the
#: operating system sends events corresponding to the start and end of
#: a resize, this number is ignored.

resize_draw_strategy static

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with an
#: initial_window_width and initial_window_height in number of cells,
#: this option can be used to keep the margins as small as possible
#: when resizing the OS window. Note that this does not currently work
#: on Wayland.

confirm_os_window_close 3

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab that has at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it. A value of zero disables
#: confirmation. This confirmation also applies to requests to quit
#: the entire application (all OS windows, via the quit action).

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge bottom

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts)

tab_bar_style powerline
tab_powerline_style slanted

#: The tab bar style, can be one of: fade, separator, powerline, or
#: hidden. In the fade style, each tab's edges fade into the
#: background color, in the separator style, tabs are separated by a
#: configurable separator, and the powerline shows the tabs as a
#: continuous line. If you use the hidden style, you might want to
#: create a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with
#: a list of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_separator " ┇"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity.

tab_title_template "{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N. In addition you can use {layout_name} for the current
#: layout name and {num_windows} for the number of windows in the tab.
#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example: {fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.default}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}green
#: bg{fmt.bg.normal}. Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: {fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs, if not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.
active_tab_font_style   bold
inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles
# tab_bar_background none

#: Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

#: Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login to ensure that the shell starts in interactive mode and
#: reads its startup rc files.

editor .

#: The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or
#: similar tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. Note that this environment
#: variable has to be set not just in your shell startup scripts but
#: system-wide, otherwise kitty will not see it.

close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

allow_remote_control yes

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty.

listen_on none

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details.

# env 

#: Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
#: that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
#: use::

#:     env MYVAR1=a
#:     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

#: The value of MYVAR2 will be a/<path to home directory>/b.

update_check_interval 24

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable.

startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#sessions in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary. You can additionally specify no-append to
#: disable kitty's protocol extension for clipboard concatenation. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: with concatenation enabled. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.

allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click by holding down ctrl+shift and clicking
#: with the mouse. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty will
#: ask before opening the link.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{
# macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, a value of
#: background means to use the background color of the currently
#: active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
#: #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack, as
#: there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color
#: of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it
#: is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both,
#: you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
#: hide_window_decorations.

macos_option_as_alt no

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique. You
#: can use the values: left, right, or both to use only the left,
#: right or both Option keys as Alt, instead.

macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (Option+Tab) on macOS.

macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes. For example, a value of
#: 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel
#: antialiasing at common font sizes.

macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but
#: less pretty.

macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Show or hide the window title in the macOS window or menu-bar. A
#: value of window will show the title of the currently active window
#: at the top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the
#: title of the currently active window in the macOS menu-bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. all will show the title everywhere
#: and none hides the title in the window and the menu-bar.

macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Enable/disable custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see
#: on both light and dark backgrounds. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines.

linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice.
